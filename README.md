# End-to-end-ML-Housing-price-prediction-
An end-to-end machine learning project to predict housing prices in California
This Machine learning project explores; all the required stages in building a machine learning project from the beginning to the end. 
It considers the following "HOWS" in a Machine learning project: 
  1) Getting the data
  2) Visualization and making meaning from discoveries
  3) Preparation of different machine learning algorithms
  4) How to select and train model
  5) How to fine tune a model
  6) How to save a model 

It gives some statements in-between to provide some clarifications in the Jupyter notebook

Dataset used is housing.csv

Jupter notebook is End-to-End ML_ Housing
